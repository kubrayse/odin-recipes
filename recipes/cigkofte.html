        <h1>Çiğ Köfte</h1>
        <img src="../images_for_recipes/cikoftefoto.jpg">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This vegan version of Turkish çiğ köfte is a delicious, spicy bulgur-based dish traditionally kneaded by hand — but in this version, a food processor does the hard work! Fine bulgur is soaked and blended with tomato paste, onions, olive oil, and a generous mix of spices like isot (Urfa pepper) and chili flakes. Pomegranate molasses and lemon juice give it a tangy depth, while the mixture is processed into a smooth, cohesive dough. Once shaped into small köfte portions, it's served with lettuce, lemon, and a glass of ayran (yogurt drink). It's a flavorful and healthy street-food favorite in Turkish cuisine.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups fine bulgur for çiğ köfte</li>
            <li>2 cups hot water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste (pepper paste can also be used)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
            <li>1 Turkish coffee cup of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 Turkish coffee cup of isot (Urfa pepper)</li>
            <li>1 Turkish coffee cup of chili flakes (can be reduced)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt (adjust if your paste is unsalted)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of pomegranate molasses</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by soaking the fine bulgur with hot water.</li>
            <li>Let it sit for about 10 minutes to soften and absorb the water.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the ingredients. Grate the onion using the fine side of a grater.</li>
            <li>Place the soaked bulgur in a food processor. If your processor has a plastic blade, use that for better texture (to avoid over-mashing), but a metal blade also works.</li>
            <li>Add the grated onion, tomato paste, isot, chili flakes, olive oil, pomegranate molasses, and lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Season with salt according to taste.</li>
            <li>Close the lid of the processor and blend on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>Let the food processor run for at least 10 minutes. Gradually mix so that the top ingredients are pulled into the blend, mimicking the kneading process.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, check the consistency — if it looks like a smooth, dough-like paste, it's ready.</li>
            <li>While the köfte is processing, you can prepare extras like lettuce, lemon wedges, or ayran for serving.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to a bowl, shape by hand into traditional köfte forms, and place on a serving plate.</li>
        </ol>
