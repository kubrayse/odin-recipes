        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe is for delicious Turkish-style stuffed and fried flatbreads, made with a soft yeast dough and filled with a savory mix of ground beef, sautéed onions, parsley, and melty cheese. The dough is prepared with warm milk and water, making it soft and airy once fried. After rising, it’s divided into small rounds, filled generously with the cooked meat mixture and cheese, folded over, and pan-fried until golden and crispy. The result is a comforting, satisfying treat that’s crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside. These stuffed flatbreads are perfect for breakfast, lunch, or as a savory snack alongside tea.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of warm milk</li>
            <li>1 cup of warm water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of dried parsley</li>
            <li>Flour (as needed to form a soft dough)</li>
            <li>100 grams of ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>A little fresh parsley (chopped)</li>
            <li>Kashar cheese (or mozzarella as a substitute)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (for sautéing and frying)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the warm milk, warm water, sugar, and yeast into a mixing bowl. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining dough ingredients and knead until you get a soft, non-sticky dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise.</li>
            <li>The rising time depends on room temperature—it typically takes 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, finely chop the onion and sauté it in 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil until golden.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and continue sautéing until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped parsley, mix, and let the filling cool.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, divide it into 19–20 small balls.</li>
            <li>Roll each ball out to about the size of a tea saucer.</li>
            <li>Place a spoonful of filling in the center, top with shredded cheese, fold over, and seal the edges.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan and fry each piece until golden brown on both sides.</li>
            <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
