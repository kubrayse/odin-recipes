        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Karnıyarık is a beloved Turkish comfort dish made by stuffing roasted eggplants with a savory mixture of ground beef, onions, and peppers, then baking it all together with a flavorful tomato-based sauce. The name “karnıyarık” translates to “split belly,” referring to the slit-down-the-middle eggplants that are filled with the rich, spiced meat mixture. Often topped with melted cheese and optionally garnished with tomatoes or green peppers, this dish is both hearty and satisfying. It’s a classic in Turkish home cooking and pairs beautifully with rice or bulgur pilaf.</p>
